    <p>To live courageously. To do everything passionately. To pursue excellence and in all things act with integrity. To be healthy in mind, body and spirit. To give more than I take and earn more than I spend. To always be learning, growing, and creating. To find the opportunity in every situation and improve with every failure as much as with every success. To encourage. To build up. To dream big and aim high. To be grounded in scripture and rooted in love. To value and protect family and friends. To stay far from arrogance and remain always teachable. To give life 100% and reach the finish line with no regrets.</p>
